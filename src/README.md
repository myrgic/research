# Self-Referential Closure (SRC)

**SRC = Self-Referential Closure**: a mathematical structure characterizing the conditions under which a self-referential system maintains an accurate, self-sustaining model of its own dynamics. A system achieves closure when its internal description X̂ tracks the external signal X well enough that the description controls the construction of the system and the system maintains the description, stabilizing into the eigenform condition φ(s\*) = s\*. This directory contains the published SRC mathematics and cross-domain instantiations that operationally ground the myrgic decentralized build-deploy-sync architecture at [https://github.com/myrgic/cogos](https://github.com/myrgic/cogos). The SRC formalism is the theoretical basis for the git branching discipline documented in `instantiations.md`.

## Contents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [definition.md](definition.md) | The SRC Model: the two coupled differential equations, the eigenform condition, and precise definition of closure. |
| [properties.md](properties.md) | Proven and conjectured properties of the SRC Model: the information threshold τ₁ = ln(2), the variance ratio a = 6 at the eigenform operating point, the uniqueness of the ρ formula under symmetric coupling, and θ-invariance. |
| [instantiations.md](instantiations.md) | Cross-domain structural parallels: independent domains (git branching, molecular biology, blockchain state management) that exhibit SRC structure, establishing the pattern across contexts. |

## Scope

This directory contains the SRC Model dynamical equations, proven properties of the model (τ₁, a = 6, θ-invariance) scoped to the symmetric-coupling case, and cross-domain instantiations that exhibit SRC structure, drawn from established literature and CogOS operational experience. The broader theoretical framework that scaffolds SRC remains internal to the myrgic project, following the convention established in [research/README.md](../README.md): this repository contains public architecture research; it does not contain the full theoretical framework or private workspace internals.

## Scope

The SRC Model sits inside a wider internal framework. Parts of that framework are
conjectural and some have been refuted by our own review — including a partition-function
identification that several downstream results depended on. Published here is the subset
that does not depend on it: the model equations, the OU invariants (τ₁ = ln(2), a = 6,
θ-invariance), and the cross-domain instantiations.

Nothing here is a claim about fundamental physics. "Established" means established within
the model equations.

## Audience

This material is written for three audiences:

1. **Theorists and mathematicians** interested in self-referential systems, fixed-point theory, and the formal properties of observer-system coupling.
2. **Cross-domain researchers** investigating whether closure-type thresholds (Eigen error catastrophe, Byzantine fault tolerance bounds, smart-contract reentrancy) reflect a common underlying structure.
3. **Practitioners adopting CogOps** who want to ground the operational rules (branch coherence thresholds, reconciliation triggers, sync policies) in the underlying mathematics rather than treating them as arbitrary conventions.

No prior knowledge of CogOS or CogOps is assumed. Familiarity with differential equations and fixed-point theory is helpful for `definition.md` and `properties.md`.

## Status

The SRC Model equations and the four core properties listed in `properties.md` are **proven** within the scope stated for each (primarily the symmetric-coupling case γ = κ). The universality of the τ₁ = ln(2) threshold across independent domains is a **conjecture under investigation**; the same constant appears across the domains documented in `instantiations.md`, but this cross-domain applicability is not asserted as a derived result.
